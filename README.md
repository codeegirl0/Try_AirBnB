Project : AirBnb Clone
Description: 
This is a team project that will contain a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell, The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between objects and their storage and persist.

A command interpreter:
it is a program that reads user instructions and  translates it to the os then execute it like shell, in this project we can use the console like that,


The command | Example of use
------- | -------
to start the console | ```./console.py```
to exit the console | ```(console) quit```
creating object | ```(console) create <class>```
show  help | ``` help <command>```
